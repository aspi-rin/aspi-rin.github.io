Departing from Tokyo, after a flight of just over an hour, I arrived at Matsuyama Airport. Ehime is Japan's main citrus fruit producing region.

Right outside the airport is a bus stop. I took the bus to tonight's hot spring hotel, located on a shopping street called "Okaido," which somewhat resembles Osaka's Shinsaibashi, though of course with fewer people.

The hot spring hotel offers free ice cream and Yakult, plus free late-night ramen. Although I didn't try any of these three, it felt like great service.

After checking out the next day, I temporarily stored my suitcase at the hotel. A ten-minute walk takes you to the cable car station for Matsuyama Castle.

Along the way, there's an orange juice faucet (Ehime's urban legend - orange juice flowing from a tap).

One cup costs 200 yen. After finishing it, I walked a few steps further to find a souvenir shop selling it for only 150 yen (betrayed!).

Natsume Soseki's novel "Botchan" - the protagonist "Botchan" and heroine "Madonna" have become cultural symbols of Matsuyama.

Matsuyama Castle. It was raining, but the experience was quite nice. Not many people around, and it was comfortable to watch the rain and feel the breeze by the windows.

This was my first time entering the interior of a Japanese castle.

Next, I took the tram to the famous Dogo Onsen. After getting off, you can see the "Botchan" train.

A shop with about 20 types of orange juice. You pour your own from the corresponding taps. One cup costs 220 to 400 yen (so expensive!).

I poured five cups, but when taking photos, I noticed the receipt only charged for four cups. I went back and paid an additional 400 yen (laughs).

Anyway, they were all basically sweet, and I regretted not bringing a bottle of water in my bag.

As for the hot springs... although I soaked for two days, I still think all hot springs are pretty much the same...
