Since there are direct flights, I took a four-day holiday to visit Qingdao. It was mostly cloudy, and in the last two days, it started raining due to a typhoon (I like rainy days). However, I felt that the air quality in Qingdao wasn't great, probably because there are too many people smoking on the streets, and the management of kitchen waste is also average... Also, I noticed a sewer-like smell at some beaches... But the main purpose of returning to China was to eat and drink.

I departed from Narita Airport and unexpectedly met a Honda engineer with a Kakashi-style hairstyle while waiting for the flight (I won't post the group photo 😄).

In the evening, I ate fish dumplings at the MixC near the hotel, then took a walk along the seaside at May Fourth Square. There were many vendors selling crafts like shells along the way. On the way back, I bought grilled cold noodles (with a very spicy sauce).

On the second day, I took a car to the seaside, walked from Lovers' Dam back to MixC, had beef hotpot for lunch, and in the afternoon, I drank milk tea and had takeout at the hotel while watching an Overwatch match.

St. Michael's Cathedral, Zhanqiao Pier (crowded with people), Lu Xun Park, and in the afternoon, I went to the Beer Museum (then it started raining). In the evening, I had a mushroom hotpot with a junior schoolmate.
